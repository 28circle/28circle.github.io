              <h3><span>What is 28*Circle?</span></h3>
              <p>I started 28*Circle because I was tired of normal Japanese-English language exchanges. I believe the best way to break the ice and get to know people is to bond over activities, and games are one of my favourite ways to do it. </p>
              <h3><span>What do you do at your events?</span></h3>
              <p>On our game nights, we play board games and video games. Games are typically in English, so Japanese knowledge isn't required, but helpful when explaining rules to Japanese members. We have a couple of Japanese games too that are easy to learn!</p>
              <h3><span>How can I join?</span></h3>
              <p>We always welcome new members! However, to continue to provide a safe, fun and relaxing environment we have to know who you are first! To that end, we require anyone wishing to join to please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/28circle/">send a brief message to our Facebook page</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1623164887958580/">apply to our group</a>, introducing themselves and mentioning why they want to join. Hopefully see you there!</p>
